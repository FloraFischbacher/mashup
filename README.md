> [!WARNING]
> Mashup is **alpha software**; for now, use of Mashup over the official mod system for Cassette Beasts is **at your own risk**! Not all of its features are implemented quite yet, and many of the features that *are* implemented could have serious issuesâ€”if you experience any issues while using Mashup, [please report them here](https://github.com/FloraFischbacher/mashup/issues).
